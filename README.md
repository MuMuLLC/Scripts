# Scripts
<P>
Storage for trading scripts that I personally use. Only will release scripts already in the public view. Or ones that have similar popular alternatives. 
 </p>
 
<p>
I have many more scripts than these and other collaborative scripts.  
These scripts are NOT AN ALGO. Although all scripts posted here have some 'Alpha' / 'edge' none of these scripts are meant to be used to trade by themselves. There should always be human execution. 
</p>

<p>
  These scripts can just be indicators that I personally use when trading equities or actaul sell/ buy signals
</p>
<p>
  These scripts will be written for one of three platforms. Tradingview (Pinescript), Ninja Trader v8, Think or Swim.
