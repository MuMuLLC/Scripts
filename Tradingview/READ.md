<P>
Storage for trading scripts that I personally use. Only will release scripts already in the public view. Or ones that have similar popular alternatives. 
Minor changes to already existing solutions for the most part.

  This acts as an archive for things I use or have used. Once part of public. Free for everyone to use and see, cannot be taken back. 
  If you are here about other scripts I have talked about, PLEASE message me directly so I can give to you. WILL NOT BE MADE PUBLIC.
